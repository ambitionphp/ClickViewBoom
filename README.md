## ClickViewBOOM

This is my take at destructive private text. ClickViewBOOM is using Laravel 8, Livewire & Tailwind. Private texts are stored to the database as encrypted content using snowflake IDs. Private texts can include a passphrase which is used to not only view the text but also to encrypt/decrypt it as well. Once a text is protected by passphrase it can never be decrypted or viewed without the passphrase.

I'm a software engineer that has been writing code in some shape or form since 1998 (I was 11 back then). I've never taken any profession classes or courses on web development, everything I know has come from genuine interest and passion for code. With that being said, a lot of my knowledge has come from open-source projects. This is my opportunity to give back (while providing transparency to those who actually use my service).

For the future I plan on cleaning up the code and transferring all the text strings to language files. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs feel free to make an issue report!
