            <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p class="text-sm mb-3">We are committed to protecting your privacy. That is because we base our business on trust you place in us. This policy describes our practices regarding personal and account information collected through our web site.</p>

            <p class="text-sm mb-3">We will periodically review the appropriateness of this privacy policy and may make, in our discretion, such changes as are necessary. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. You should visit our web site periodically to review any changes.</p>

            <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">Do we use the secret data for any other purpose?</h1>

            <p class="text-sm mb-3">No. We currently do not analyze or look at the secrets in any manual or automated way. Secrets are encrypted before stored in our database, only decrypted when viewed and deleted instantly upon being viewed.</p>

            <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">How safe is this tool?</h1>

            <p class="text-sm mb-3">We feel that this tool is definitely safer than using email or chat tools to send private information. However, if you are concerned that <span class="font-bold">any</span> third party (ie. us) holding this data is a risk, then you should consider either encrypting the data first and passing the credentials for this one-time via another means, or use something else altogether (GnuPG is a good candidate).</p>

            <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">What personal and account information do we collect?</h1>

            <p class="text-sm mb-3">We collect and log as little data is possible. Currently we do not log any personal details such as location, device or browser. All secrets are considered to be anonymous. They are encrypted before stored in our database and deleted instantly upon being viewed.</p>

            <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">What measures do we use to protect your personal information?</h1>

            <ul class="list-disc text-gray-800 text-sm mb-3 pl-4">
                <li>We use secure, encrypted mechanisms (SSL) when accepting and transmitting information.</li>
                <li>We regularly perform security audits and updates on our servers.</li>
            </ul>
